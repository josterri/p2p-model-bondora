    "In graph theory, a graph is a collection of nodes (also known as vertices) and edges. The nodes represent entities or elements, while the edges represent the connections or relationships between these entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes**: Nodes, also referred to as vertices, are the fundamental units in a graph. They represent individual elements or entities within a network. Nodes can represent various things depending on the context of the graph. For example, in a social network graph, nodes can represent individuals, while in a transportation network, nodes can represent cities or intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edges**: Edges are the connections or links between nodes in a graph. They represent the relationships or interactions between the entities represented by the nodes. Edges can be directed or undirected, depending on whether the relationship between nodes has a specific direction or not. Directed edges have an arrow indicating the direction of the relationship, while undirected edges have no specific direction. Edges in a graph represent relationships or interactions between the nodes. The nature of these edges can be very diverse depending on the context of your data and the problem you are solving. Here are a few examples of how edges can be defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Social Networks**: If your nodes are individuals, an edge could represent a friendship, a follow, or a connection on a social media platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Financial Networks**: If your nodes are banks, an edge could represent lending and borrowing relationships. In a financial transaction network, an edge could represent a transaction between two individuals.\n",

    "3. **Communication Networks**: If your nodes are individual email addresses, an edge could represent the exchange of emails between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collaboration Networks**: If your nodes are scientists, an edge could represent co-authorship on a paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Infrastructure Networks**: If your nodes are cities, an edge could represent a direct road or flight connection between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your specific case, as you're dealing with a financial dataset (default/no default), the creation of edges depends on the context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your data includes transactions, you could create edges between entities that have transactions between them.\n",
    "- If your dataset includes information about co-signers or guarantors on loans, you could create edges between these connected individuals.\n",
    "- If your entities belong to the same group (like same organization or family), you could draw edges between them.\n",
    "- You could define edges based on similarity or proximity in the feature space. For instance, you could use a threshold value on a given feature or use a clustering method to group similar entities and then create edges within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a meaningful graph, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of your data and the relationships you're trying to represent. It's important to choose an edge definition that makes sense for your specific problem and dataset."

    "Centrality measures are techniques used in network analysis to identify the most important nodes in a network. There are several types of centrality measures, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Degree Centrality**: It is simply the number of edges connected to a node. In directed networks, we can differentiate between in-degree and out-degree centralities.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For an undirected graph, the degree centrality \\(C_D(v)\\) for a node \\(v\\) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   <div style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\">\n",
    "   \\(C_D(v) = \\text{deg}(v)\\)\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "   where \\(\\text{deg}(v)\\) is the degree of the node \\(v\\), i.e., the number of edges incident upon \\(v\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   For a directed graph, we can define in-degree centrality and out-degree centrality. The in-degree centrality for a node \\(v\\) is the number of incoming edges to \\(v\\), and the out-degree centrality is the number of outgoing edges from \\(v\\).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Closeness Centrality**: It measures how fast information can spread from a given node to other reachable nodes in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <div style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\">\n",
    "   \\[C(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{y}d(y, x)}\\]\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this formula, \\(d(y, x)\\) is the shortest-path distance from \\(y\\) to \\(x\\), and the sum is over all nodes \\(y\\) in the same connected component as \\(x\\). The idea is that the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Betweenness Centrality**: It is a measure of a node's centrality in a network equal to the number of shortest paths from all vertices to all others that pass through that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The mathematical formula for betweenness centrality \\(C_B(v)\\) for a node \\(v\\) is:\n",

    "   </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this formula, \\(V\\) is the set of nodes, \\(\\sigma(s, t)\\) is the total number of shortest paths from node \\(s\\) to node \\(t\\), and \\(\\sigma(s, t|v)\\) is the number of those paths that pass through \\(v\\).\n",

    "   Reference: Freeman, L. C. (1977). A set of measures of centrality based on betweenness. Sociometry, 35-41.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Eigenvector Centrality**: A node is considered important if it is connected to other important nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The mathematical formula for eigenvector centrality \\(C_E(v)\\) for a node \\(v\\) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   <div style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\">\n",

    "   </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this formula, \\(M(v)\\) is the set of the neighbors of \\(v\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) is a constant. In other words, the eigenvector centrality for a node is the sum of the centrality scores of its neighbors, scaled by a constant factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The calculation of eigenvector centrality is indeed iterative and based on the centrality of the neighboring nodes. This is because the importance of a node in the network is determined not only by how many connections it has, but also by how important its connections are.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The calculation of eigenvector centrality is typically done through the power iteration method. Here's a simplified explanation of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Assign all nodes an initial centrality score. This could be a score of 1 for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. For each node, calculate its new centrality score as the sum of the centrality scores of its neighbors from the previous iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Normalize the centrality scores so that their sum is 1. This is to prevent the scores from growing or shrinking exponentially in the next iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the scores converge, i.e., the scores do not change significantly from one iteration to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The result is a vector of centrality scores that is the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of the graph, hence the name \"eigenvector centrality\".\n",
    "\n",
    "   Eigenvector centrality is a measure of the influence of a node in a network. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes.\n",

    "5. **PageRank**: is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. It works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites. The mathematical formula for PageRank \\(PR(p)\\) for a page \\(p\\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   <div style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\">\n",

    "   </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this formula, \\(M(p)\\) is the set of pages that link to \\(p\\), \\(L(i)\\) is the number of outbound links on page \\(i\\), and \\(d\\) is a damping factor, usually set to 0.85. The idea is that a page's PageRank is derived from the PageRanks of the pages that link to it. Each of these contributing pages transfers its PageRank to \\(p\\) proportionally to the number of outbound links it has.\n",

    "6. **Katz centrality**: Katz centrality is a measure of centrality in a network that takes into account both the direct and indirect influence of a node's neighbors. It was introduced by Leo Katz in his paper \"A New Status Index Derived from    Sociometric Analysis\" published in 1953.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Katz centrality of a node \\(i\\) is defined as the sum of the contributions from all its neighbors, weighted by a factor \\(\\beta\\) and the number of paths of length \\(k\\) connecting the neighbors to the node \\(i\\). The formula for Katz centrality can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   <div style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\">\n",
    "   \\(C_{\\text{Katz}}(i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\beta A_{ij} C_{\\text{Katz}}(j) + \\alpha\\)\n",
    "   </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - \\(C_{\\text{Katz}}(i)\\) represents the Katz centrality of node \\(i\\).\n",
    "   - \\(A_{ij}\\) denotes the adjacency matrix element, indicating the presence or absence of an edge between nodes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).\n",
    "   - \\(\\beta\\) is a scaling factor that controls the weight given to indirect paths. Typically, \\(|\\beta| < \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}}\\), where \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}\\) is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix.\n",
    "   - \\(\\alpha\\) is a constant term representing the node's intrinsic centrality.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Katz centrality algorithm is iterative. Starting with an initial centrality value for each node, the centrality values are updated iteratively using the above formula until convergence is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Katz centrality is useful for identifying influential nodes in a network, as it considers both direct and indirect connections. Nodes with higher Katz centrality scores are considered more central or influential within the network.\n",

    "6. **HITS Algorithm**: The HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) algorithm, also known as hubs and authorities, is a link analysis algorithm that rates webpages, developed by Jon Kleinberg. The idea behind Hubs and Authorities stemmed from a particular insight into the creation of web pages when the Internet was originally forming; that is, certain web pages, known as hubs, served as large directories that were not actually authoritative in the information that they held, but were used as compilations of a broad catalog of information that led users to direct to other authoritative pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the context of HITS, each node in a graph has two scores: an authority score and a hub score.\n",

The edges could represent some relationship between them.\n",

    "However, the computation of centrality doesn't typically involve the use of predictive features as inputs, but rather the structure of the network itself (who is connected to whom). If you have some prediction task related to the nodes of the network, the centrality measures can be used as features to help predict that task.\n",

    "Here's a brief explanation of each of these measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Degree Centrality**: In a weighted graph, degree centrality is still calculated as the number of edges connected to a node. This means that nodes with more connections will have a higher degree centrality. However, it doesn't take into account the weight of the edges, meaning that the strength of the connections is not considered in this measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Closeness Centrality**: This measure calculates the reciprocal of the sum of the shortest path distances from a node to all other nodes in the graph. So, a higher value of closeness centrality implies that a node is more central. In a weighted graph, the 'distances' considered are the weights of the edges, so a node that has stronger connections to all other nodes (i.e., higher edge weights) will have higher closeness centrality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Betweenness Centrality**: This is a measure of the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness centrality have a large influence on the transfer of items through the network, under the assumption that item transfer follows the shortest paths. When weights are considered, shorter paths are those with higher total weights, so nodes that lie on the paths with the strongest connections will have higher betweenness centrality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Eigenvector Centrality**: This is a measure of the influence of a node in a network. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the principle that connections to nodes with high score contribute more to the score of the node in question. In a weighted graph, connections to nodes with high scores and high edge weights contribute more to the score of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that each of these measures captures a different aspect of a node's centrality, and the appropriate measure to use depends on the specifics of your problem and dataset."

Note that logistic regression is a relatively simple model, and depending on your dataset, you might achieve better performance with more complex models, such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines or Neural Networks. Also, always consider performing model validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) and hyperparameter tuning for a more reliable and better performing model."
