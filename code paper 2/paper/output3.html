li_technology_2017: The technology and economic determinants of cryptocurrency exchange rates: The case of Bitcoin (Li, Xin, 2017)
Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have ignited intense discussions. Despite receiving extensive public attention, theoretical understanding is limited regarding the value of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, as expressed in their exchange rates against traditional currencies. In this paper, we conduct a theory-driven empirical study of the Bitcoin exchange rate (against USD) determination, taking into consideration both technology and economic factors. To address co-integration in a mix of stationary and non-stationary time series, we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model with a bounds test approach in the estimation. Meanwhile, to detect potential structural changes, we estimate our empirical model on two periods separated by the closure of Mt. Gox (one of the largest Bitcoin exchange markets). According to our analysis, in the short term, the Bitcoin exchange rate adjusts to changes in economic fundamentals and market conditions. The long-term Bitcoin exchange rate is more sensitive to economic fundamentals and less sensitive to technological factors after Mt. Gox closed. We also identify a significant impact of mining technology and a decreasing significance of mining difficulty in the Bitcoin exchange price determination. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.<br>fry_negative_2016: Negative bubbles and shocks in cryptocurrency markets (Fry, John, 2016)
In this paper we draw upon the close relationship between statistical physics and mathematical finance to develop a suite of models for financial bubbles and crashes. The derived models allow for a probabilistic and statistical formulation of econophysics models closely linked to mainstream financial models. Applications include monitoring the stability of financial systems and the subsequent policy implications. We emphasise the timeliness of our contribution with an application to the two largest cryptocurrency markets: Bitcoin and Ripple. Results shed new light on emerging debates over the nature of cryptocurrency markets and competition between rival digital currencies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.<br>baur_bitcoin_2018: Bitcoin, gold and the US dollar – A replication and extension (Baur, Dirk G., 2018)
Dyhrberg [2016. Bitcoin, gold and the dollar – A GARCH volatility analysis. Finance Research Letters 16, 85–92] analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin, gold and the US dollar and states that Bitcoin can be classified as something in between gold and the US dollar. This paper uses the same sample and econometric models to replicate the findings and demonstrates that exact replication is not possible and that alternative statistical methods provide more reliable, yet very different results. The findings based on the original sample and an extended sample period show that Bitcoin exhibits distinctively different return, volatility and correlation characteristics compared to other assets including gold and the US dollar. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.<br>albayati_accepting_2020: Accepting financial transactions using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency: A customer perspective approach (Albayati, Hayder, 2020)
Blockchain, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, are innovative FinTech technologies that speedily invade the finance market and changing the power of the global economy. However, there was a low acceptance of these technologies among consumers. There is a clear gap in-between that has not yet been taken into consideration and has been misunderstood on many platforms. This paper intends to estimate the usability of blockchain technology by investigating behavioral elements that affect customers' intention towards blockchain-based cryptocurrency transactions. Given the complexity of the technology, this study proposes a new integration model: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) together with new external variables regarding blockchain adoption characteristics such as trust, regulatory support, social influence, design, and experience. Surveys were conducted among international users to identify the impacts of these variables on their intention. Our findings indicate two powerful constructs (regulatory support and experience) that encourage customer trust towards blockchain-based applications. People surveyed agreed on a great sense of security and can trust the Blockchain-based applications when they are regulated and insured by the local government. Also, at a certain level of experience, users feel confident to use blockchain-based applications, a high level of trust supports technology adoption. As such, governments and businesses can dedicate efforts to enhance customers' trust and ultimately promote better acceptance of blockchain technology and its applications. © 2020<br>ahluwalia_blockchain_2020: Blockchain technology and startup financing: A transaction cost economics perspective (Ahluwalia, Saurabh, 2020)
Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, EOS, Etherum, Litecoin, and others) are disrupting the traditional banking and financial systems. The cryptocurrencies are based on a set of technologies commonly referred to as blockchain technology. The potential effect of blockchain technology on institutional economics is profound. Already, blockchain technology-based applications in supply chain management, marketing, and finance are decentralizing and streamlining vital institutional functions. In this paper, we examine the economics of blockchain technologies as it pertains to transaction costs in startup financing. We draw upon the theory of transaction cost economics and the transactional nature of blockchain technology to propose a model to demonstrate how and why blockchain technology based applications are effective. We then apply the model to demonstrate how blockchain technology can be used to overcome many problems inherent in startup financing. For example, information asymmetry and transaction costs involved with matching an entrepreneur with an investor and the terms of the financing deal are some of the fundamental issues in entrepreneurial financing. We explain how a financing system based on blockchain technology can ameliorate the problems and lead to a more effective and decentralized entrepreneurial financing process. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.<br>franco_understanding_2014: Understanding bitcoin: Cryptography, engineering, and economics (Franco, Pedro, 2014)

(White, Reilly, 2020)
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have fascinated technologists and investors alike. They have become prevalent, with over 2,000 Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies now in use. Most jurisdictions have not regulated cryptocurrencies. Whether existing regulations apply to cryptocurrency turns ultimately on if we classify cryptocurrencies as currencies, securities, or derivatives, or a money services (transfer) vehicle. In this set of exploratory analyses we seek to classify Bitcoin. We utilize a variety of methods to compare aspects of its behavior to: currencies, asset classes such as derivatives, technology-based products and possible technology-based products such as Ether and the security SPY, and speculative financial bubbles. We find that Bitcoin's behavior more closely resembles a technology-based product, an emerging asset class, or a bubble event, rather than a currency or a security; such that it is correct that existing currency and security laws should not apply to cryptocurrencies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.<br>holub_bitcoin_2018: Bitcoin research across disciplines (Holub, Mark, 2018)
Over the last few years, research on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has snowballed across many disciplines: technical fields, economics, law, public policy, finance, accounting, and others. As the uses of blockchain technology behind Bitcoin expand, more disciplines will be drawn to its study and the research will greatly expand. This paper provides an assessment of the current state of the literature. From a comprehensive search of the literature that resulted in an original sample of 13,507 results, a final sample of 1,206 papers on Bitcoin are categorised and mapped across six disciplines. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © Mark Holub and Jackie Johnson.<br>arenas_credenceledger_2018: CredenceLedger: A Permissioned Blockchain for Verifiable Academic Credentials (Arenas, Rodelio, 2018)
Blockchain, the underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is gaining so much attention from different industry stakeholders, governments and research communities. Its application is extending beyond cryptocurrencies and has been exploited in different domains such as finance, E-commerce, Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and governance. Some key attributes of the technology are decentralization, immutability, security and transparency. This paper aims to describe how permissioned Blockchain can be applied to a specific educational use case - decentralized verification of academic credentials. The proposed Blockchain-based solution, named 'CredenceLedger', is a system that stores compact data proofs of digital academic credentials in Blockchain ledger that are easily verifiable for education stakeholders and interested third party organizations. © 2018 IEEE.
