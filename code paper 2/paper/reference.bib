	abstract = {Abstract Personal credit data usually contain a large number of features, some of which do not significantly contribute to the performance of default prediction models. Screening features through appropriate methods is essential to improve the efficiency of prediction models. However, little attention has been paid to feature selection methods in the area of personal loan default prediction. In this study, we employ random forest (RF), XGBoost, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) as base algorithms of wrapper and embedded methods to select features and use these algorithms as classifiers to predict personal loan default. We find that when classical filter methods are used to select features, the number of selected features needs to be large enough to enable tree-based classifiers to get their best performance. However, when the tree-based algorithm is used to select features, it only needs to select a small number of features to deliver a satisfactory classification performance. AdaBoost, Chi2, and F-score are found to be ideal feature selection methods in the area of personal credit default prediction. Moreover, we find that it is better to use different algorithms in feature selection and classification; AdaBoost and CatBoost perform the best among all classifiers.},

	abstract = {SummaryThis paper describes TRUSTPACK, a decentralized trust management framework that provides trust management as a generic service. TRUSTPACK is unique in that it does not provide a central service. Instead, it is run by many autonomous services. This design enables TRUSTPACK to alleviate privacy concerns, as well as potentially provide better personalization and scalability when compared with current centralized solutions. A major component of TRUSTPACK is a generic decentralized graph query processing framework called GRAPHPACK, which was also developed as part of this work. GRAPHPACK consists of a decentralized graph processing language as well as an execution engine, as elaborated in this paper. The paper also presents several examples and a case study showing how TRUSTPACK can be used to handle various trust management scenarios, as well as its incorporation in an existing third party P2P file sharing application. Prototypes of TRUSTPACK and GRAPHPACK are available as open source projects at http://code.google.com/p/trustpack/ and http://code.google.com/p/graphpack/, respectively.

	abstract = {Summary This study proposes an investment recommendation model for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. P2P lenders usually are inexpert, so helping them to make the best decision for their investments is vital. In this study, while we aim to compare the performance of different artificial neural network (ANN) models, we evaluate loans from two perspectives: risk and return. The net present value (NPV) is considered as the return variable. To the best of our knowledge, NPV has been used in few studies in the P2P lending context. Considering the advantages of using NPV, we aim to improve decision-making models in this market by the use of NPV and the integration of supervised learning and optimization algorithms that can be considered as one of our contributions. In order to predict NPV, three ANN models are compared concerning mean square error, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error to find the optimal ANN model. Furthermore, for the risk evaluation, the probability of default of loans is computed using logistic regression. Investors in the P2P lending market can share their assets between different loans, so the procedure of P2P investment is similar to portfolio optimization. In this context, we minimize the risk of a portfolio for a minimum acceptable level of return. To analyse the effectiveness of our proposed model, we compare our decision-making algorithm with the output of a traditional model. The experimental results on a real-world data set show that our model leads to a better investment concerning both risk and return.},

Access to lending has today become cheap and ubiquitous.

Micro credit and lending systems, most recently popularized by the likes of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and new online social platforms such as Kiva.org, have given broader access to credit in communities that have traditionally not had access to such. One accepted measure of overall credit risk management performance for lending institutions today is default rate, or more specifically expressed as a charge-off rate. In the last 2 to 3 years P2P Lending has improved its viability as a new asset class and maintained respectable default rates.},

	abstract = {Abstract The choice of market mechanism is key to success for any online marketplace. In recent years, as peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has seen phenomenal growth, leading P2P lending platforms have used various market mechanisms and, in some cases, even switched from one mechanism to another, chasing higher market share and overall growth. While Prosper.com, a leading P2P lending platform, has switched from the auction lending model to a fixed price lending model, recent studies show that overall social welfare was higher with the auction lending model. While the auction lending model gives more power to the lenders, the success of the auction lending model hinges on the accuracy of lenders? assessment of the credit risk of the borrowers. Building on extant literature and in support of the auction lending model to increase social welfare, we design an artifact to dynamically estimate borrower reputation to help the lenders and improve the allocative efficiency in P2P lending markets. We posit that borrowers? reputation built on transactional data, readily available on P2P lending platforms, represents the collective perception of the lenders about the borrowers. We propose a dynamic latent class model of reputation and use the latent instrumental variable approach to deal with endogeneity. We test our artifact using real-world P2P lending data. We show that accounting for reputation improves the model's explanatory power and provides a way to empirically model the evolution and impact of reputation in online platforms where repeated transactions are performed.},

	abstract = {Summary Portfolios can be managed passively or actively. Passive allocations are investments in an index fund. This management style is attractive because it minimizes trading costs and eliminates most management fees while earning the return on the index. Managers, who believe they can beat the index, presumably because they have superior information or skills, or both, relative to other market participants, on the other hand, make active allocations. Active management can be thought of as shorting the benchmark and going long the active portfolio. The active allocation therefore, generates a return differential, relative to the benchmark, as well as a risk differential, referred to as the active portfolio's tracking error. In addition, active management is important to understand because virtually all managers manage relative to a bogey, that is, some notion of an opportunity cost embodied by a passive portfolio. This chapter describes how active management changes the objective function in the solution to the optimal mean-variance efficient portfolio, how the notion of risk is transformed to tracking error, returns to the notion of risk-adjusted alpha, and the decomposition of risk in active space.},

Because of its relevance, it is important to study and understand its behaviour and impact from several points of view, including those related to communication efficiency and security risks. In this paper, we analyse BitTorrent network focusing on the behaviour of shared resources. For that, we develop a monitoring methodology that allows to extract the time evolution of a sample of 1/256 of all the resources shared in the network. As a main difference with previous approaches, our methodology allows to monitor distributed hash table-based BitTorrent networks, that is, without considering trackers. We discuss the data obtained from a monitoring process carried out during 3 months, and as a result, we analyse the information of more than 70?000 resources. This analysis is based on four features: geographic dispersion, popularity, sharing duration and availability. Finally, we show the potential of our methodology by outlining an example application that consists of a detection system intended to identify anomalous behaviours in the sharing of BitTorrent resources.

Therefore, different classification methods can be utilized to predict the status of loans in the future. Our study aim is to propose an investment decision model based on the nondefault loans predicted using three different classifiers, including random forest (RF) that is a multitude of decision trees, support vector machine, and naïve Bayes. In fact, we combine each of these classifiers with the portfolio optimization problem to understand which combination leads to the best portfolio concerning the risk and return. In order to find the best combined model, numerical studies are conducted based on real-world data. In addition, the performances of these classifiers are evaluated based on different performance measures using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The results indicate that combining the RF algorithm and portfolio optimization problem leads to the least level of risk. Moreover, it is concluded that RF is the best classifier in terms of performance analysis.},

	abstract = {Objective In the world of credit, the moving force for a consumer is the credit score. A high credit score will help secure good credit with favorable terms and even a somewhat lower credit score might assist in getting credit, albeit at more costly terms. However, no credit score is likely to be a deterrent to gaining credit. A credit score might also be required to gain services other than financial credit, such as access to a rental property or obtaining certain types of jobs. This is especially problematic for individuals who have insufficient credit information to derive credit scores and who are classified as thin-file individuals. Some maintain that there might be individuals with thin files who are creditworthy despite not having a credit score. This report explores this assertion quantitatively and investigates if there are any identifiable patterns in former thin-file individuals qualifying for credit scores. The study also discusses the use of alternative data to assist in scoring thin-file individuals. Methods We use the Equifax database to follow two samples of thin-file individuals with no credit scores for at least four years in order to develop a timeline indicating when they obtained sufficient credit to qualify for a credit score. Results Our findings document that many individuals with thin files in fact proved to be creditworthy. Some of them even became homeowners. Their eventual credit scores ranged from below 520 to 740 and above. Moreover, most of them qualified for a credit score within three to four years. Furthermore, during this four-year timeframe, the majority received credit scores in the first and second years. Conclusions Even though many individuals with thin files qualify for credit scores within a relatively short period of time, the wait time might be made even shorter if alternative credit data are used to help score them.},

Finally, the reliability coefficient and the credit value are introduced into the simulated electricity transaction. The results show that the transaction verification time of the traditional electricity transaction model is 410?seconds at the highest and 330?seconds at the lowest. Meanwhile, the transaction verification time of the blockchain-based distributed power transaction model is 410?seconds at the highest and 300?seconds at the lowest, which means the blockchain-based distributed power transaction has a lower transaction verification time and more efficiency, effectively suppressing the frequency of defaults, reducing the risk of being attacked, and enhancing security.},

It is critical to control the cost of debt collection incurred in late repayments and defaults. We study whether and how a platform can leverage on borrowers? social connections and use automatic social notifications in regulating repayment behavior. In collaboration with a large online P2P lending platform, we conduct a randomized field experiment to investigate the effect of social notifications targeted at different contact groups (core-circle and peripheral-circle groups). Our results indicate that notifying social contacts of a delinquent regarding the overdue payment significantly improves the repayment rate. Compared with the control group in which no notification messages are sent to social contacts, notification-triggered social sanctions and social support reduce the default rate by more than 50\% in both core-circle and peripheral-circle groups. Furthermore, we find that social notifications targeted at peripheral-circle social contacts are only effective in the short term, and its effectiveness decreases with repeated use. By contrast, social notifications targeted at core-circle social contacts have a lasting effect.},

The existing financial infrastructure in Japan is dysfunctional. Along with a declining population and increase in underutilized real estate, there are an increasing number of real-estate projects for which existing financial institutions, such as banks, are unlikely to provide loans due to lack of collateral value, low risk tolerance of the institution and low liquidity of the assets. The securitization of real estate in Japan is still at an early stage compared with what is seen in developed countries. An online peer-to-peer (P2P) direct financing marketplace can solve issues of Japanese wealth management. The creation of a Japanese distributed P2P financial system will balance the supply and demand of capital by P2P transactions.

Minimal research has been conducted on the impact of concealing such information on borrowers? funding success. We fill this research gap by exploring a natural experiment opportunity at Prosper, an online lending marketplace where the platform enacted a policy to conceal borrowers? past failure history. We first find that the platform's decision to conceal such information can be rational because when this information was publicly available, borrowers with past failures had lower success rates than borrowers without past failures. We next investigate the effect of hiding this information on lenders' lending decisions. Our empirical results from a series of analyses demonstrate that concealing such information helps some borrowers but also surprisingly leads to an overall lower success rate, which ultimately harms the platform and runs counter to the platform's intention. These effects are strongest for low-risk borrowers and would attenuate in the long run. We further find that the number of borrowers? past failures is associated with lower repayment ability.},

We show that when peers are homogeneous, upload compensation increases with propagation delay uncertainty, maximum uploading nodes allowed, peers' provision cost and disutility of download delay, but decreases with the network size and content availability. We also characterize a general contracting model where there are a countable number of peer classes which are heterogeneous in their provisioning costs. For the case of two peer classes where optimal delays are separable, we derive the optimal upload compensations under different scenarios and show that the impact of operational parameters is quite similar to the case of homogeneous peers, lending support to the robustness of our analysis.},

This can mainly be attributed to the easy and quick access to loans and the higher possible returns. However, the risk involved in these investments is considerable, and for most investors, being nonprofessionals, this increases the complexity and the importance of investment decisions. In this study, we focus on generating optimal investment decisions to lenders for selecting loans. We treat the loan selection process in P2P lending as a portfolio optimization problem, with the aim being to select a set of loans that provide a required return while minimizing risk. In the process, we use internal rate of return as the measure of return. As the starting point of the model, we use machine-learning algorithms to predict the default probabilities and calculate expected values for the loans based on historical data. Afterwards, we calculate the distance between loans using (i) default probabilities and, as a novel step, (ii) expected value. In the calculations, we utilize kernel functions to obtain similarity weights of loans as the input of the optimization models. Two optimization models are tested and compared on data from the popular P2P platform Lending Club. The results show that using the expected-value framework yields higher return.},

	abstract = {Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks utilize centralized entities (trackers) to assist peers in finding and exchanging information. Although modern P2P protocols are now trackerless and their function relies on distributed hash tables (DHTs), centralized entities are still needed to build file indices (indexing) and assist users in joining DHT swarms (bootstrapping). Although the functionality of these centralized entities are limited, every peer in the network is expected to trust them to function as expected (e.g. to correctly index new files). In this work, a new approach for designing and building decentralized online applications is proposed by introducing DIBDApp. The approach combines blockchain, smart contracts and BitTorrent for building up a combined technology that permits to create decentralized applications that do not require any assistance from centralized entities. DIBDApp is a software library composed of Ethereum smart contracts and an API to the BitTorrent protocol that fully decentralizes indexing, bootstrapping and file storing. DIBDApp enables any peer to seamlessly connect to the designed smart contracts via the Web3J protocol. Extensive experimentation on the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet shows that applications built using the DIBDApp library can perform the same operations as in traditional back-end architectures with a gas cost of a few USD cents.},

We find that student borrowers are distinct from other types of borrowers, not only with respect to factors that existed prior to joining the market, but also in terms of information generated during loan requests, subsequent cancellation behavior, repayment performance, and even in the composition and predictive accuracy of loan repayment models. However, individual investors are not fully aware of the unique attributes of student borrowers in their funding decisions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Financial leverage volatility is a significant factor contributing to the formation of systemic financial risk, which is more apparent in China's fast-growing fintech (financial technology) field. Using the Conditional Value-at-risk approach (?CoVaR) risk metric, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (Structural Vector Autoregression with Stochastic Volatility model [SV-TVP-SAVR]) model, and the generalized forecast error variance decomposition (Tvpdy) model, this paper discusses how financial leverage volatility shocks fintech sectoral risks and the evolution of the risk within fintech under the shocks on the basis of the classification criteria of the Chinese fintech enterprise database and daily trading data of A-share listed companies. The statistical results show that financial leverage volatility causes risk changes across fintech sectors, which is especially significant during economic downturns or government interventions. Also, under the shock of financial leverage volatility, the fintech sectors will absorb or diffuse risks outward through spillover channels, with significant differences in the risk spillover conditions of different types of sectors. Finally, the fintech sector can produce a contagion system with the Internet consumer finance, payment, and Internet microcommercial credit sectors as the core of risks, resulting in a systemic risk crisis. Our findings have major implications for Chinese regulators to balance financial leverage and prevent systemic risks in the fintech sector.},

	abstract = {Abstract There is a never-ending debate about whether the cap-and-trade mechanism is a valid means of achieving carbon reduction. In this study, we examine it from the perspective of supply chain financing, as the cap-and-trade scheme appears to be an excellent solution to avoid the carbon emission requirements imposed by green credit financing services. We develop a theoretical framework for comparing three distinct kinds of financing modes: bank credit financing, green credit financing, and green credit financing with a cap-and-trade scheme. Based on Stackelberg game with stochastic demand, we then derive optimal outputs for the manufacturer and wholesale prices for the supplier. Counterintuitively, the green credit financing mode is less profitable for manufacturers with low investment in clean production due to stringent carbon emission requirements, yet it is advantageous for the supplier through a higher wholesale price. Conversely, the green credit financing combined with cap-and-trade scheme will result in a different situation in which the manufacturer will benefit from the green credit's lower interest rate, but the cap-and-trade mechanism will diminish the supplier's power in the Stackelberg game and reduce her profits. Finally, from the perspective of social welfare, the green credit financing mode with cap-and-trade scheme will not always benefit for the whole society. Even though it can improve the profit of the manufacturer and consumer surplus, it may lead to higher carbon emission and reduce profits of the supplier when the investment in clean production technology is limited.},

Based on fifteen months of fieldwork, this article presents a failed yet influential social experiment of digital finance in the world's largest developing economy. This article examines the morality of the P2P market by observing how the aspirational public script of financial inclusion is maintained and experienced through a hidden technological script that alienates the notion of ?peer.? This article argues that the morality of the market is not only about ?seeing? and judging from a distance but also about ?feeling? and managing the moral boundaries and intersubjective distances between actors. These altered distances restructure interpersonal responsibilities and sustain the dreams and imagination that shape financial subjects on an unconscious level. The article expands the concept of market relationality beyond direct interactions between actors and uncovers the inherent tensions within the dream of financial inclusion.

	abstract = {Abstract Blockchain technology has been recognised as a promising technology for supporting Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading?an emerging paradigm in which energy trading is performed directly between end energy customers. The state-of-the-art blockchain designs for P2P energy trading can only support less compute-intensive energy trading tasks and/or rely on the set up of a long challenge time to ensure correctness of transactions, which restricts the systems' scalability and applicability in the diverse P2P energy trading applications. This paper proposes a new dual-blockchain system for P2P energy trading. The system consists of a primary blockchain and a secondary blockchain. The primary blockchain is mainly responsible for storing the data of P2P energy trading transactions while the compute-intensive tasks (e.g. pricing and transaction verification) are executed in the secondary blockchain. An Improved Optimistic Rollup (IOR) mechanism is proposed to facilitate the co-operation of the dual blockchains. Through a specific ?executor-validator? mechanism and a group of specific smart contracts with different functions, the IOR mechanism can effectively accommodate the dual blockchains to execute the P2P energy trading transactions in a computational efficient manner while ensuring the correctness and security of the transactions. A prototype of the proposed system is implemented on Fisco Bcos and Alibaba Cloud and comprehensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed system.},

This study mainly discusses the advanced manufacturing economic supply chain management under the blockchain (BC) technology. The smart contract function in the BC will strengthen the execution of credit agreements between enterprises. In the application scenario of smart contract, as long as one party performs its economic activities, the system will force the other party to perform the contract directly, which improves the credibility of all parties in the chain and reduces the risk of default. To avoid false trade, commercial factoring risk management, one is to establish a cooperative relationship with banks. The second is to issue asset securitization products. Third, cooperate with internet financial platform. In 2018, under the background of slower growth in operating income, the balance of accounts receivable of enterprises fell more, and 2019 performance it began to pick up, and the substantial increase in operating income has also brought about a substantial increase in accounts receivable. Since then, operating income has maintained a rapid growth rate, but the balance of accounts receivable has not increased significantly, but has decreased slightly. After the implementation of supply chain financing, the proportion of accounts receivable of B advanced manufacturing company in operating revenue has decreased from 23.17\% in 2018 to 13.45\% in 2020.

This paper documents the automation of the back-end in the current wave of digitization.

For instance, automated ?big data? credit scoring tools built on predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms are employed to examine several credit propositions. This can accurately construct the credit worthiness and risk profile of public, even without any credit history. These developments can widen the access of credit and other financial services to the society. However, on a cautionary note, this study emphasizes that although digitization of back-end financial transactions carries substantive advantages, the FIs must be guarded against cyber, outsourcing, financial exclusion, and macrofinance risks that can manifest with this automation. In this backdrop, the need for robust yet agile regulations and supervisory counsel to control and exploit the digitization towards optimal benefits for banks and FIs and society at large, acquires salience. Furthermore, regulators and supervisory authorities can mitigate the digitization risks and prevent any public fallout by leveraging the use of digitization itself.},

	abstract = {Abstract The convention of selling on credit (to customers) results in mass accumulation of accounts receivable (AR) on the balance sheet of firms. However, capital-constrained firms do not have enough capital to invest in AR and cover the production cost incurred during the credit period. To finance future business, a capital-constrained firm can employ factoring?a financing scheme wherein firms sell AR to a financial institution (called a factor) at a discount?to advance cash from AR. By formulating a time-continuous model with constant demand over an infinite horizon, we study the factoring policy of firms in two practice-based discounting schemes: automatic discounting and manual discounting. In the automatic discounting scheme, AR should be discounted at the same age, whereas this requirement is relaxed in the manual discounting scheme and how long in advance to discount the AR is contingent over time. In both discounting schemes, the firm needs to choose the timing of discounting in order to reach a capital-unconstrained state as soon as possible. In the automatic discounting scheme, we approximate the firm's objective function with a quasi-convex function whose error is demonstrated to be small. Based on this approximation, the firm's optimal decision and the factor's profit can be calculated more easily. When manual discounting is adopted, the firm should meet all the demand by exploiting factoring if the profit margin under immediate discounting is nonnegative. Given the same factoring discount rate, manual discounting is always more attractive to the firm than automatic discounting. However, the preference of the factor over the two discounting schemes depends on the factoring discount rate.},

These regulations introduced in 2016 mainly focus on the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in this country and tend to be negatively associated with firm performance, especially for those firms investing in the P2P lending platforms, as a large amount of P2P lending platforms with unfavourable performance disappear in recent years, which may end up negatively affecting those firms investing in them. Survived P2P lending platforms tend to be stronger, then become a type of substitute of traditional banks and are able to carve up the market share of bank. The latter therefore has to increase credit supply to maximise profits, which leads to the access to more credits and therefore worse firm performance, especially for those firms with financial constraints in terms of the cash?cash flow sensitivity. The empirical results are robust to the potential endogeneity issue of financial constraints. Larger firms and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) tend to have better performance, implying that authorities may take actions for smaller firms (non-SOEs) to offset the negative impacts of financial innovation regulations they suffer and achieve better implementation of financial innovation regulations, which comes to the practical contribution of this paper.},

	abstract = {Summary This chapter explains how online lending works, and outlines the different business models in online lending, namely marketplace lending, balance-sheet lending, and lender-agnostic marketplaces. By using technology and Big Data innovatively, online lenders fulfill two important functions: they lower search costs for borrowers and address the difficulties in assessing the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. Technology also improves ease of use and rapid turn around of applications and capital disbursements. Many network systems have developed with the idea of decentralization in mind. Even though they may not necessarily meet the technical definition of a peer-to-peer software application, distributing a resource across its users has many applications offline as well. From the perspective of borrowers, marketplace loans compare to credit card debt and short-term consumer loans in terms of interest rate. Underwriting of many online lenders looks quirky at best to some traditionalists in the financial sector.},

As with banking, these appear to be operational efficiency, customer growth and risk management. Digitalisation refers to the concept of Digital Healthcare, which requires ?a transformation to a delivery model centered on the consumer and the digital delivery network?, and needs a ?coordinated approach to digital health planning and implementation?. In a digital age, healthcare providers should rethink how they ?conceive of, and approach their capital resources?. This requires them to ensure alignment of their capital expenditure to their strategic objectives, to be prudent with their ?build/buy/partner decisions? and to investigate alternative sources of capital.},

	abstract = {Summary Credit scoring is one the most important parts of credit risk management in reducing the risk of client defaults and bankruptcies. Deep learning has received much attention in recent years, but it has not been implemented so intensively in credit scoring compared to other financial domains. In this article, stacked unidirectional and bidirectional LSTM (long short-term memory) networks as a complex area of deep learning are applied in solving credit scoring problems for the first time. The proposed robust model exploits the full potential of the three-layer stacked LSTM and BDLSTM (bidirectional LSTM) architecture with the treatment and modeling of public datasets in a novel way since credit scoring is not a time sequence problem. Attributes of each loan instance were transformed into a sequence of the matrix with a fixed sliding window approach with a one-time step. Our proposed models outperform existing and much more complex deep learning solutions thus we succeeded in preserving simplicity. In this article, measures of different types are employed to carry out consistent conclusions. The results by applying three hidden layers on the German Credit dataset showed an accuracy of 87.19\%, for Kaggle dataset accuracy reached 93.69\%, and for Microcredit dataset accuracy of 97.80\%.},

	abstract = {Abstract Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has emerged as an innovative financial technology (FinTech) platform that renders financial services that are potentially more inclusive and affordable than those offered by traditional financial institutions. A similar purpose is served by cryptocurrency markets, where transaction costs are reduced and financial accessibility is improved based on disruptive technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledgers. Despite these developments, however, in the operations management literature limited attention has been devoted to the contribution of online P2P lending to the promotion of financial inclusion (i.e., the availability and usage of financial services for all groups of people) and its dynamic interplay with cryptocurrency markets. The rise of cryptocurrency markets affects the composition and activity of borrowers and investors in P2P lending markets and hence the capacity of the latter to support financial inclusion, leading to an operations management challenge in online P2P lending. We examine how cryptocurrency markets influence P2P lending markets' democratization of access to financial services, particularly P2P borrowing. To investigate these effects in depth, we develop a simple theoretical model to derive testable propositions, which are then empirically validated on the basis of unique data sets. We find that the growth in cryptocurrency markets is associated with increased loan requests and larger loan amounts in P2P markets, especially from borrowers who maintain good credit ratings, possess technical knowledge about cryptocurrencies, and intend to borrow for investment purposes. Our results suggest that cryptocurrency markets bring economic gains to the P2P lending market, at least in the short term. Nonetheless, the transfer of funds from P2P lending to cryptocurrency markets, particularly by highly creditworthy and tech-savvy investors, may provoke increased inequality in access to P2P lending markets. By scrutinizing the interdependence between two representative FinTech markets we uncover important operations management implications for theory and practice regarding the healthy growth and effective governance of crowdfunding platforms and the corresponding sustainability of their role in upholding financial inclusion.},

Yield curves and forward rate models play the role of arbitrage-free from current to future time models. This chapter highlights that using arbitrage-free models reduces the complexity in applying financial analysis; it also aligns with the expected behavior of investors, which is to avoid risk whenever possible. There are two main views in looking at and analyzing markets. The first point of view is based on the risk neutral concept serving the need of applying arbitrage risk-free in the discounting process and pricing financial instruments. The second is considering the real-world probabilities.},

We formulate a three-echelon Stackelberg game in which the bank is a leader, the e-commerce platform is a subleader, and the retailer is a follower. We analytically derive the optimal interest rates of the bank and the e-commerce platform and the optimal order quantity of the retailer. Compared with the nonfinancing case, we characterize the regions of the interest rates charged by the bank and the e-commerce platform under which Pareto improvement can be achieved. We also present the retailer's financing preference under equilibrium and show how the initial capital affects the retailer's financing selection. Numerical examples demonstrate that the retailer's order quantity and expected profit increase with the bank's loan ratio.},

PCs are still the preferred technology for online shopping in the United Kingdom but the continued growth of mobile commerce (MC) is highly correlated with the success of remote MPs (RMPs). Currently MP research has largely ignored the variations between different MP solutions, and existing MP adoption studies have predominantly utilized Davis? (1989) Technology Acceptance Model, which has been criticized for having a deterministic approach without much consideration for users? individual characteristics. Therefore, this study applied the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), extended with more consumer-related constructs, to explore the factors affecting nonusers? intentions to adopt RMP in the United Kingdom. Quantitative data were collected (n = 268) and structural equation modeling was undertaken. The findings revealed that performance expectancy, social influence, innovativeness, and perceived risk significantly influenced nonusers? intentions to adopt RMP, whereas effort expectancy did not. Inclusion of MP knowledge as a moderating variable revealed that there was a significant difference in the effect of trust on behavioral intention for those who knew about MP than for those who did not. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, particularly for the development and marketing of RMP, which will support the long-term success of MC.},

With this in mind, we test the relationship between a borrower's education level and the interest rate, loan amount, and loan maturity based on more than 10,000 transactions from Renrendai.com. Controlling for a variety of other factors, we find on average that an individual with a higher education level obtains a lower interest rate, larger loan amount, and longer maturity.

	abstract = {Abstract While peer-to-peer (P2P) financing mechanisms have recently gained significant popularity, small and medium sized enterprise (SME) entrepreneurs still harbor a considerable degree of skepticism about the role of governments in promoting alternative supply chain finance (SCF) solutions in the re-emergence of supply chain (SC) localization. This paper studies the SC financing problem of a capital-constrained SME entrepreneur under two alternative financing schemes provided by an online P2P lending-investment platform, namely debt financing (DF) and equity financing (EF). Considering the competition between a local and a foreign SC in a shared market, we investigate the direct (i.e., subsidizing domestic production) and indirect (i.e., subsidizing P2P platform service fee) roles of government intervention toward SC localization. Formulating a three-level Stackelberg game model, this paper presents a scenario-based decision-making framework to jointly evaluate four different SCF scenarios through the lens of local SC, P2P financing platforms, and government. The results reveal that there exist three possible regions (i.e., DF, EF, and Conflict), within which the government and the P2P financing platforms can examine the alternative SCF schemes in order to achieve a mutually agreeable agreement. Our sensitivity analysis on interest rate and exchange ratio suggests that, when financed via an online P2P lending platform (i.e., DF), the local SC always achieves a higher profit under the direct intervention policy. The indirect policy, however, is preferred only when EF is the main source of SCF and the exchange ratio is sufficiently high.},

	abstract = {Abstract Peer to peer systems are bringing Windows-based computers onto the Internet as full participants. Peer to peer systems utilize the connectivity and capacity to share resources offered by the Internet without being bound by the constraints imposed by the domain name system. Peer to peer (P2P) systems are so named because each computer has the same software as the other?every computer is a peer. In contrast, an application on a server is far more powerful than the client that accesses the server. Peer computers are fundamentally equals. In the history of the network, computation has cycled, from distributed on the desktop to concentrated in one centralized location. Peer to peer systems are at the decentralized end of the continuum. P2P systems utilize the processing power or data storage capacities at the end points of the Internet. The fundamental basis of P2P is cooperation. Therefore P2P systems require trust. Cooperation is required to share any resource, whether it be two children splitting chocolate cake or two million people sharing files. Discussions of P2P therefore require some discussion of trust and security. P2P systems are powerful because they are able to leverage computers that are not consistently identified by domain name or IP address, are not always connected to the network, have highly variable processing power when connected, and are not designed to have particular server capabilities other than that provided by the peering network. The systems are built to withstand high uncertainty and therefore can accept contributions from anyone with a connection, even a modem. After considering the generic issues of P2P systems specific systems are described: Napster, SETI @home, Gnutella, Freenet, Publius, and Kazaa. Limewire and Morpheus are implementations of Gnutella. Rougher introductions are provided for commercial peer to peer systems Groove and Tenix. The specific systems are used to illustrate problems of coordination and trust. Coordination includes naming and searching. Trust includes security, privacy, and accountability (J. L. Camp, ).},

This paper provides a novel credit scoring model, which forecasts the probability of default for each applicant and guides the lenders' decision-making in P2P lending. The proposal is expected to improve the existing credit scoring models in P2P lending from two aspects, namely the classifier and the usage of narrative data. We utilize an advanced gradient boosting decision tree technique (i.e., CatBoost) to predict default loans. Moreover, a soft information extraction technique based on keyword clustering is developed to compensate for the insufficient hard credit data. Validated on three real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that variables extracted from narrative data are powerful features, and the utilization of narrative data significantly improves the predictability relative to solely using hard information. The results of sensitivity analysis reveal that CatBoost outperforms the industry benchmark under different cluster numbers of extracted soft information; meanwhile a small number of clusters (e.g., three) is preferred for consideration of model performance, computational cost, and comprehensibility. We finally facilitate a discussion on practical implication and explanatory considerations.},

	abstract = {Summary The rapidly growing cloud computing paradigm provides a cost-effective platform for storing, sharing, and delivering data and computation through internet connectivity. However, one of the biggest barriers for massive cloud adoption is the growing cybersecurity threats/risks that influence its confidence and feasibility. Existing threat models for clouds may not be able to capture complex attacks. For example, an attacker may combine multiple security vulnerabilities into an intelligent, persistent, and sequence of attack behaviors that will continuously act to compromise the target on clouds. Hence, new models for detection of complex and diversified network attacks are needed. In this article, we introduce an effective threat modeling approach that has the ability to predict and detect the probability of occurrence of various security threats and attacks within the cloud environment using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM is a powerful statistical analysis technique and is used to create a probability matrix based on the sensitivity of the data and possible system components that can be attacked. In addition, the HMM is used to provide supplemental information to discover a trend attack pattern from the implicit (or hidden) raw data. The proposed model is trained to identify anomalous sequences or threats so that accurate and up-to-date information on risk exposure of cloud-hosted services are properly detected. The proposed model would act as an underlying framework and a guiding tool for cloud systems security experts and administrators to secure processes and services over the cloud. The performance evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach to find attack probability and the number of correctly detected attacks in the presence of multiple attack scenarios.},

We leverage insights from the literature on psychological distancing and affective intensity to argue that linguistic styles, as the manifestation of social psychological distance, have a negative impact on P2P funding success. Testing our arguments with data from a major Chinese P2P platform, we find that using too many ?you? and negations (proxies for social psychological distance) in the borrower's description will dampen a lender's willingness to support a funding campaign. Moreover, when the social psychological distance is large, language intensity can be perceived as desperate, making a lender even less willing to support the funding campaign. Our research shed new light on the role of language in P2P funding success and has practical implications for lenders, borrowers and regulators in overcoming barriers in P2P lending.},

The former one develops outside the insurance market whereas the latter ones may originate from the insurance industry, by partnering with an existing company or by issuing a new generation of participating insurance policies where part of the risk is shared within a community and higher losses, exceeding the community's risk-bearing capacity are covered by an insurance or reinsurance company. The present paper proposes an actuarial modeling based on conditional mean risk sharing, to support the development of this new P2P insurance offer under each of the three business models. In addition, several specific questions are also addressed in the self-governing model. Considering an economic agent who has to select the optimal pool for a risk to be shared with other participants, it is shown that uniform comparison of the Lorenz or concentration curves associated to the respective total losses of the pools under consideration allows the agent to decide which pool is preferable.},

Second, compared to the video-information-absent borrowers, the otherwise borrowers can get easier access to a loan and offer a lower interest rate. These results indicate that compared to text messages, video information can increase the borrower's creditworthiness and reduce the transaction risk. Thereupon seeing is important in online P2P lending. Third, when the borrower's credit rating is lower, the video effect is significant.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: What is the impact of bankruptcy risk on whether listed corporations are likely to be bought out by private equity firms and on the subsequent exit, including bankruptcy, of private equity backed public to private buyouts? Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 246 UK companies that went from public to private (P2P) company status from 1997 to 2005, we find that companies going private have a significantly higher default probability. Private equity firms sponsoring P2P deals acquire firms with a higher risk of bankruptcy than non-acquired firms that remain public. We find evidence that high receivership risk at going private increases the chance that the target will end up in receivership, but post-P2P bankruptcy likelihood is less when the P2P is a management buyout rather than any other form of buyout. Independent boards of pre-P2P targets promote P2P deals and reduce the chances of bankruptcy after the buyout, suggesting a good corporate governance structure makes a positive contribution to bankruptcy avoidance after going private transactions. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our finding that P2P deals involve targets with a higher risk of bankruptcy adds to theoretical insights about private equity. In contrast to previous research, it suggests that PE firms are not deterred by the risk of financial distress but consider it a value creating opportunity. Our use of the option pricing framework represents a first and novel attempt at measuring bankruptcy risk and its impact on the ability of private equity firms to achieve effective turnaround. We find a link between better governance of the target pre-P2P and lower bankruptcy risk since where the PE investor inherits a strong governance structure, manifested in independent boards, chances of subsequent bankruptcy are reduced. Similarly, where the P2P acquisition is a management buyout, the probability of bankruptcy, post-P2P, is reduced, suggesting lower informational asymmetries and better alignment of interests between managerial and private equity investors. Although, due to the small number of receivership exits in our sample of P2P firms, the results are not as strong as we would like, a more extended analysis involving a larger sample over a longer period, in particular of firms exiting through bankruptcy is expected to produce stronger results. Our results provide a sufficient basis to warrant such further analysis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Private equity backed P2Ps of listed corporations with high bankruptcy risk augment the market for corporate control as they provide an alternative purchaser to traditional acquirers. Our finding that high bankruptcy risk at going private increases the chance the target will end up in receivership suggests a need for caution on the part of private equity firms since the turnaround of P2P targets appears to depend on how seriously distressed they are at the P2P stage. Private equity firms therefore need to engage in careful due diligence. Private equity firms need to give attention to the nature of the pre-P2P governance regime when selecting P2P targets, in particular the extent to which better monitoring by independent directors has been in place and where there is greater alignment of interests between managers and LBO sponsors since these contribute to bankruptcy avoidance. For listed corporations, our findings suggest that strengthening of independent boards may contribute to timely decisions to sell troubled corporations.},

	abstract = {SUMMARYAs peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems revolve around cooperation, the design of upload incentives has been one of the most important topics in P2P research for more than a decade. Several deployed systems, such as private BitTorrent communities, successfully manage to foster cooperation by banning peers when their sharing ratio becomes too low. Interestingly, recent measurements have shown that such systems tend to have an oversupply instead of an undersupply of bandwidth designers that have been obsessed with since the dawn of P2P. In such systems, the ?selfish peer? problem is finally solved, but a new problem has arisen: because peers have to keep up their sharing ratios, they now have to compete to upload. In this paper, we explore this new problem and show how even highly cooperative peers might in the end not survive the upload competition. On the basis of recent measurements of over half a million peers in private P2P communities, we propose and analyze several algorithms for uploader selection under oversupply. Our algorithms enable sustained sharing ratio enforcement and are easy to implement in both existing and new systems. Overall, we offer an important design consideration for the new generation of P2P systems in which selfishness is no longer an issue. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Most aggregation is via a combination of disparate DER technologies such as solar, wind, storage, electric vehicles, and smart load units. Another stumbling block to enabling participation of DERs in organized electricity markets is the energy limitation. However, there is a lack of aggregator models in the literature that gainfully allow aggregation of disparate DER technologies that are energy limited. To address this shortcoming, we proposed a disparate DER aggregator (DDA) planning model here, that overcomes energy limitation of DERs. The DDA planning model considers multiple revenue streams of (1) capacity credits; (2) energy revenues; and (3) ancillary services revenues. The proposed DDA planning model enables disparate DER technologies to collate and provide a firm power capacity and participate in the market capacity auction and receive capacity credits. This comprehensive DDA planning model considers the dynamic/temporary aggregations with other facilities through peer-to-peer (P2P) trade, and maximization of the net present value (NPV) revenues over the planning horizon. The developed model is tested on sample and practical large-scale case studies. Additional sensitivity analyses are performed, demonstrating the favourable performance and the business potential of the developed DDA planning model.},

In general, users have access to a highly heterogeneous set of compute resources, which may include clusters, grids, desktop grids, clouds, and other compute platforms. This heterogeneity is especially problematic when running parallel and distributed applications. Software is needed which easily combines as many resources as possible into one coherent computing platform. In this paper, we introduce Zorilla: peer-to-peer (P2P) middleware that creates a single distributed environment from any available set of compute resources. Zorilla imposes minimal requirements on the resource used, is platform independent, and does not rely on central components. In addition to providing functionality on bare resources, Zorilla can exploit locally available middleware. Zorilla explicitly supports distributed and parallel applications, and allows resources from multiple sites to cooperate in a single computation. Zorilla makes extensive use of both virtualization and P2P techniques. We will demonstrate how virtualization and P2P combine into a simple design, while enhancing functionality and ease of use. Together, these techniques bring our goal a step closer: transparent, easy use of resources, even on very heterogeneous distributed systems. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) and its integration into every field, it has yielded positive results that have increased productivity and aided us in solving complex problems. Deep learning (DL) is a subset of AI developed to mimic the human brain. It is a way for a computer to perform actions that come naturally to humans. It is a tool extensively used to organize unsupervised or unlabeled data and find patterns in them. DL has had a major impact on the field of medical science owing to its applications in medical drug discovery, medical imaging, genome synthesis, disease diagnosis, and much more. The growth of DL in this field has increased significantly owing to the processing and type of data used in the models. Focusing on the type of data, preexisting or curated, can drastically affect the success rate of a DL model. DL is used to diagnose diseases such as skin lesions, brain disease, and chronic disease. To understand the application of DL in disease diagnosis and how it has become one of the most efficient methods for disease diagnosis, this chapter will examine the different architectures of DL, such as convolutional neural networks, feed forward networks, and recurrent neural networks, and how their diagnosing methods compare with traditional disease diagnosis methods. In addition, it will explore advantages and disadvantages of DL compared with traditional methods by comparing various efficiency parameters such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, area under the curve, and receiver operating characteristics curve, showing how DL is more effective and produces better results. However, DL faces numerous obstacles. If these are overcome, it will lead to even better results and complete autonomous disease diagnosis.},

Unfortunately, however, the time complexity of DeLong's algorithm is of quadratic order (the product of sample sizes), thus making it time-consuming and impractical when the sample sizes are large. Based on an equivalent relationship between the Heaviside function and mid-ranks of samples, we improve DeLong's algorithm by reducing the order of time complexity from quadratic down to linearithmic (the product of sample size and its logarithm). Monte Carlo simulations verify the computational efficiency of our algorithmic findings in this work.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},
