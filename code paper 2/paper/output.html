babaei_application_2023: Application of credit-scoring methods in a decision support system of investment for peer-to-peer lending (Babaei, Golnoosh, 2023)
Abstract Peer-to-peer lending, as a novel lending model, has challenged investors to make effective investment decisions. Issued loans are grouped into default and nondefault. Therefore, different classification methods can be utilized to predict the status of loans in the future. Our study aim is to propose an investment decision model based on the nondefault loans predicted using three different classifiers, including random forest (RF) that is a multitude of decision trees, support vector machine, and naïve Bayes. In fact, we combine each of these classifiers with the portfolio optimization problem to understand which combination leads to the best portfolio concerning the risk and return. In order to find the best combined model, numerical studies are conducted based on real-world data. In addition, the performances of these classifiers are evaluated based on different performance measures using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The results indicate that combining the RF algorithm and portfolio optimization problem leads to the least level of risk. Moreover, it is concluded that RF is the best classifier in terms of performance analysis.<br>bai_concealing_2023: Concealing borrowers’ failure history in online {P2P} lending: {A} natural experiment (Bai, Jiaru, 2023)
Abstract Online peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms both disclose and conceal borrowers? information. Minimal research has been conducted on the impact of concealing such information on borrowers? funding success. We fill this research gap by exploring a natural experiment opportunity at Prosper, an online lending marketplace where the platform enacted a policy to conceal borrowers? past failure history. We first find that the platform's decision to conceal such information can be rational because when this information was publicly available, borrowers with past failures had lower success rates than borrowers without past failures. We next investigate the effect of hiding this information on lenders' lending decisions. Our empirical results from a series of analyses demonstrate that concealing such information helps some borrowers but also surprisingly leads to an overall lower success rate, which ultimately harms the platform and runs counter to the platform's intention. These effects are strongest for low-risk borrowers and would attenuate in the long run. We further find that the number of borrowers? past failures is associated with lower repayment ability.<br>chung_interdependence_2023: Interdependence between online peer-to-peer lending and cryptocurrency markets and its effects on financial inclusion (Chung, Sunghun, 2023)
Abstract Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has emerged as an innovative financial technology (FinTech) platform that renders financial services that are potentially more inclusive and affordable than those offered by traditional financial institutions. A similar purpose is served by cryptocurrency markets, where transaction costs are reduced and financial accessibility is improved based on disruptive technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledgers. Despite these developments, however, in the operations management literature limited attention has been devoted to the contribution of online P2P lending to the promotion of financial inclusion (i.e., the availability and usage of financial services for all groups of people) and its dynamic interplay with cryptocurrency markets. The rise of cryptocurrency markets affects the composition and activity of borrowers and investors in P2P lending markets and hence the capacity of the latter to support financial inclusion, leading to an operations management challenge in online P2P lending. We examine how cryptocurrency markets influence P2P lending markets' democratization of access to financial services, particularly P2P borrowing. To investigate these effects in depth, we develop a simple theoretical model to derive testable propositions, which are then empirically validated on the basis of unique data sets. We find that the growth in cryptocurrency markets is associated with increased loan requests and larger loan amounts in P2P markets, especially from borrowers who maintain good credit ratings, possess technical knowledge about cryptocurrencies, and intend to borrow for investment purposes. Our results suggest that cryptocurrency markets bring economic gains to the P2P lending market, at least in the short term. Nonetheless, the transfer of funds from P2P lending to cryptocurrency markets, particularly by highly creditworthy and tech-savvy investors, may provoke increased inequality in access to P2P lending markets. By scrutinizing the interdependence between two representative FinTech markets we uncover important operations management implications for theory and practice regarding the healthy growth and effective governance of crowdfunding platforms and the corresponding sustainability of their role in upholding financial inclusion.<br>deng_actions_2023: Actions speak louder than words: {Imputing} users’ reputation from transaction history (Deng, Jiaying, 2023)
Abstract The choice of market mechanism is key to success for any online marketplace. In recent years, as peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has seen phenomenal growth, leading P2P lending platforms have used various market mechanisms and, in some cases, even switched from one mechanism to another, chasing higher market share and overall growth. While Prosper.com, a leading P2P lending platform, has switched from the auction lending model to a fixed price lending model, recent studies show that overall social welfare was higher with the auction lending model. While the auction lending model gives more power to the lenders, the success of the auction lending model hinges on the accuracy of lenders? assessment of the credit risk of the borrowers. Building on extant literature and in support of the auction lending model to increase social welfare, we design an artifact to dynamically estimate borrower reputation to help the lenders and improve the allocative efficiency in P2P lending markets. We posit that borrowers? reputation built on transactional data, readily available on P2P lending platforms, represents the collective perception of the lenders about the borrowers. We propose a dynamic latent class model of reputation and use the latent instrumental variable approach to deal with endogeneity. We test our artifact using real-world P2P lending data. We show that accounting for reputation improves the model's explanatory power and provides a way to empirically model the evolution and impact of reputation in online platforms where repeated transactions are performed.<br>gicić_intelligent_2023: Intelligent credit scoring using deep learning methods (Gicić, Adaleta, 2023)
Summary Credit scoring is one the most important parts of credit risk management in reducing the risk of client defaults and bankruptcies. Deep learning has received much attention in recent years, but it has not been implemented so intensively in credit scoring compared to other financial domains. In this article, stacked unidirectional and bidirectional LSTM (long short-term memory) networks as a complex area of deep learning are applied in solving credit scoring problems for the first time. The proposed robust model exploits the full potential of the three-layer stacked LSTM and BDLSTM (bidirectional LSTM) architecture with the treatment and modeling of public datasets in a novel way since credit scoring is not a time sequence problem. Attributes of each loan instance were transformed into a sequence of the matrix with a fixed sliding window approach with a one-time step. Our proposed models outperform existing and much more complex deep learning solutions thus we succeeded in preserving simplicity. In this article, measures of different types are employed to carry out consistent conclusions. The results by applying three hidden layers on the German Credit dataset showed an accuracy of 87.19\%, for Kaggle dataset accuracy reached 93.69\%, and for Microcredit dataset accuracy of 97.80\%.<br>huang_psychological_2023: Psychological distancing and language intensity in {Peer}-to-{Peer} lending (Huang, Jin, 2023)
Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is referred to as lending money to unknown borrowers directly through online platforms without using traditional financial intermediaries. We leverage insights from the literature on psychological distancing and affective intensity to argue that linguistic styles, as the manifestation of social psychological distance, have a negative impact on P2P funding success. Testing our arguments with data from a major Chinese P2P platform, we find that using too many ?you? and negations (proxies for social psychological distance) in the borrower's description will dampen a lender's willingness to support a funding campaign. Moreover, when the social psychological distance is large, language intensity can be perceived as desperate, making a lender even less willing to support the funding campaign. Our research shed new light on the role of language in P2P funding success and has practical implications for lenders, borrowers and regulators in overcoming barriers in P2P lending.<br>lu_pricing_2023: Pricing strategies in {BigTech} lending: {Evidence} from {China} (Lu, Lei, 2023)
Abstract This paper analyzes a BigTech lender's pricing strategies in the business-to-customer unsecured loan market using a proprietary data set of consumer loans in China. We find that the credit rating constructed by the BigTech lender is informative of the customers' default risk. Moreover, the interest rate decreases and the credit limit increases with the credit rating. Interestingly, the BigTech lender charges different interest rates to its customers based on the customer channel, although it does not provide information about the customers' default risk. Following the passage of the China Banking Regulatory Commission Act, which reduced credit market competition, the BigTech lender increased the current rate and decreased the credit limit. We rationalize these empirical findings in a simple model of credit contract design.<br>ma_does_2023: Does green credit financing mode with cap-and-trade scheme really benefit all members? (Ma, Junhai, 2023)
Abstract There is a never-ending debate about whether the cap-and-trade mechanism is a valid means of achieving carbon reduction. In this study, we examine it from the perspective of supply chain financing, as the cap-and-trade scheme appears to be an excellent solution to avoid the carbon emission requirements imposed by green credit financing services. We develop a theoretical framework for comparing three distinct kinds of financing modes: bank credit financing, green credit financing, and green credit financing with a cap-and-trade scheme. Based on Stackelberg game with stochastic demand, we then derive optimal outputs for the manufacturer and wholesale prices for the supplier. Counterintuitively, the green credit financing mode is less profitable for manufacturers with low investment in clean production due to stringent carbon emission requirements, yet it is advantageous for the supplier through a higher wholesale price. Conversely, the green credit financing combined with cap-and-trade scheme will result in a different situation in which the manufacturer will benefit from the green credit's lower interest rate, but the cap-and-trade mechanism will diminish the supplier's power in the Stackelberg game and reduce her profits. Finally, from the perspective of social welfare, the green credit financing mode with cap-and-trade scheme will not always benefit for the whole society. Even though it can improve the profit of the manufacturer and consumer surplus, it may lead to higher carbon emission and reduce profits of the supplier when the investment in clean production technology is limited.<br>nguyen_big_2023: Big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning: {A} transformative symbiosis in favour of financial technology (Nguyen, Duc Khuong, 2023)
Abstract This paper uses a multidimensional descriptive analysis to familiarize the reader with the extent of penetration of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in the financial technology roadmap. We propose a clear framework for the symbiotic nature of these data science themes towards fintech empowerment. The framework is validated through their impact on fintech, financial services' profession and the shifting paradigm of the data scientist role. We also discuss the dark side of this symbiosis, while AI and ML techniques are tied with the future challenges of AI ethics, regulation technology and the smart data utilization.<br>polyzos_perfect_2023: The perfect bail-in: {Financing} without banks using peer-to-peer lending (Polyzos, Efstathios, 2023)
Abstract We explore the potential outcomes for financial stability when using peer-to-peer lenders to finance economic activity. Combining Random Regression Forests, a machine-learning process, with an agent-based model, we perform simulations on artificial economies with various degrees of adoption of peer-to-peer lending. We find that as peer-to-peer lenders proliferate, there is increased financial instability, lower GDP and higher unemployment. On the other hand, peer-to-peer lending increases the total volume of loans given out but demonstrates a preference towards consumer loans (over corporate loans), which has a negative effect in the long run. Finally, introducing peer-to-peer lenders increases the access of the unbanked to services which conventional banking is not able to offer within the extant regulatory framework. Our results can help policymakers as they address the issue of regulation in the peer-to-peer finance industry.
