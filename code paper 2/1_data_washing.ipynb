    "\n",
    "2. **Betweenness**: In the context of betweenness centrality, the weight of an edge can be interpreted as the cost of traversing the edge. A lower weight means that it's less costly to traverse the edge. Therefore, nodes connected by low-weight edges will have a higher betweenness centrality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Closeness**: In the context of closeness centrality, the weight of an edge can be interpreted as the distance between the nodes. A lower weight means that the nodes are closer to each other. Therefore, nodes connected by low-weight edges will have a higher closeness centrality.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Understand adjacency and distance matrix\n",
    "A Gower's distance matrix and an adjacency matrix are both square matrices that represent relationships between entities, but they are used in different contexts and convey different types of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gower's Distance Matrix**: This matrix is used in the context of cluster analysis or hierarchical clustering. Each entry in the matrix represents the Gower's distance between two entities (e.g., individuals, observations, etc.). Gower's distance is a measure of dissimilarity between two entities and takes into account both numerical and categorical variables. The smaller the Gower's distance, the more similar the two entities are.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjacency Matrix**: This matrix is used in the context of graph theory. Each entry in the matrix indicates whether two vertices (i.e., nodes) in a graph are adjacent to each other. In an unweighted graph, the entries are binary (0 or 1), indicating the absence or presence of an edge between two vertices. In a weighted graph, the entries can be any non-negative real number, representing the weight of the edge between two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, a Gower's distance matrix could be transformed into a form of adjacency matrix. For example, you might create a graph where each entity is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if their Gower's distance is below a certain threshold. The resulting adjacency matrix would represent a graph of entities that are similar to each other according to the Gower's distance. However, this would be a specific use case and not a general relationship between Gower's distance matrices and adjacency matrices."

    "1. **Adjacency Matrix**: An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. In an unweighted graph, the elements of the adjacency matrix (A[i][j]) indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph -- 1 for adjacent, 0 for not adjacent. In a weighted graph, the elements of the adjacency matrix represent the weights of the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance Matrix**: A distance matrix is a square matrix containing the distances, taken pairwise, between the elements of a set. In an unweighted graph, the elements of the distance matrix (D[i][j]) represent the number of edges in the shortest path between each pair of vertices. In a weighted graph, the elements of the distance matrix represent the sum of the weights of the shortest path between each pair of vertices.\n",
